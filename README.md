ICT Project - Automatic Pipe Cutting Machine
--------------------------------------------

The objective of this project was to design and develop an automated pipe cutting machine capable of accurately measuring and cutting PVC pipes. The primary goal was to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the cutting process while improving the safety of the operator by minimizing human interventions. 

Throughout the project, we gained valuable knowledge about various types of sensors, motors, and the fundamentals of microcontrollers. We also acquired skills in reading datasheets and designing printed circuit boards (PCB) from this project, 

The programming aspect of the project was conducted using the C language to control the sensors and motors.

Individual Contribution :

     1. Programming a 4x4 keypad to get user inputs.
     2. Programming an IR sensor to identify a distance.
     3. Designing a power supply unit.
