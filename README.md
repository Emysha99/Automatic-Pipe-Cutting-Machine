ICT Project - Automatic Pipe Cutting Machine
--------------------------------------------
This is our level 1 hardware project which was based on AtMega-32 Micro-controller.This project aimed to design and develop an automated pipe cutting machine to measure and cut PVC pipes.This machine improves efficiency and effectiveness of cutting process and enhance safety level of the operator by reducing human interventions.

We were able to learn about different types of sensors , motors and basics of micro-controller through this project.C language was used to programme all the sensors and motors.

My Individual Contribution :

     1.Programming a 4x4 keypad to get user inputs
     2.Programming an IR sensor to identify a distance.
